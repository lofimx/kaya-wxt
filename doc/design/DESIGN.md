# Kaya Design

**Colors**: 

* Colors should follow the system theme (dark/light)
* Use theme system, never hardcoded values

**Accessibility**:
* Alt text/labels required for icons (use `null` only for decorative)
* Don't rely solely on color - pair with icons/text
* Loading indicators must have labels for screen readers
